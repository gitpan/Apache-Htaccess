         existing htaccess file or from scratch

  save()

                 $obj->save();

         Saves the htaccess file to the filename designated at object
         creation. This method is automatically called on object
         destruction.

  global_require()

                 $obj->global_require(@groups);

         Sets a global group requirement. If no params are provided, will
         return a list of the current groups listed in the global require.

  requires()

                 $obj->requires($file,@groups);

         Sets a group requirement for a file. If no params are given,
         returns a list of the current groups listed in the files require
         directive.

  directives()

                 $obj->directives(CheckSpelling => 'on');

         Sets misc directives not directly supported by the API. If no
         params are given, returns a list of current directives and their
         values.
